## mindset of a developer
**A developer should know some points before start working and also should develope the right mindset before starting working on projects and coding, this mindset should include most of the following points : the purpose of the software being worked on, the feature needed to meet the demand, the code should be as simple as possible because otherwise it will create problems for the maintainence in the future, also assumptions must be avoided because it will lead to unneccesary lines, pritorize whats important and what is not for your software to avoid complexity in the code.... here i just mentioned a couple of points that the developer should know before starting to avoid problems in the future and to make the code easy to read and easy to understand so other developers can use and maintain**
